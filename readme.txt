This folder contains the working files associated with the neurofeedback paper submitted to the CITE 2015 technical conference in Regina, SK
An abstract was developed and submitted on November 14, 2014. Conditional acceptance is expected by early January. 
The folder also contains the data files that were collected from various runs on routes that had been used in the past two papers that were submitted to CITE.
These covers the topics of Risk Compensaton Theory (RCT) and Fractal geometric approach to clustering of road crashes using the Cantor Set.
The data was collected using bio (Electrodermal Response - EDR and Neurofeedback - NFB) with the neuorsky headset and home-made EDR unit connected to a Sparkfun Redboard.
